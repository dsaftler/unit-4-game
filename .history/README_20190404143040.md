# unit-4-game

I've added a couple of "features"
1. There are four nubmers in the crystal array, and all random 1-12. I was seeing duplicates frequently.:
	My logic only adds to the array if the number doesn't already exist.
2. I find it hard enough to work out the math without having to remember the four numbers.:
	I added "?" as a title to each image div - 
	that changes to the value once the button is clicked so that the values can be seen prior to clicking
3. I figured out how to make the "Value" part of Random Number, Current Points, Wins, & Losses change without
	having to refresh the whole "text" tag, by using an internal Span... could have used that on the hangman game...
